This repository contains an early implementation of the code that
eventually ended up in https://github.com/bassosimone/2023-12-09-ooni-javascript/,
where the `pkg/dsl` has been rearranged to use channels according to the
https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/2545 issue while the javascript engine
code is virtually unmodified.

The `pkg/dsl` package is basically the same that we wrote in
https://github.com/ooni/2023-05-richer-input/commit/04b348188b52943de97136a7e0d3a27bb0a3c100.
